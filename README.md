# INFOVIS-airplanes
First project for the [Information Visualization Course](http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~infovis/) held by professor Pratignani at the Roma Tre University.

The goal of the project is to draw the silhouette of 30 little airplanes using JavaScript and D3.js.
Those airplanes move towards the cursor (slowly and with random speed). Overlaps are permitted.
When an airplane reaches the mouse it disappears and reappears in a random spot.
